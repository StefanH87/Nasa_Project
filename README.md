# Nasa_Project
Read Weather Data from the NASA API

A small data project.
The data was read from the NASA API.


The data of forest fires worldwide were selected.

With the Python script, the longitude and latitude were used to determine the exact locations (city, region, territory, country).

The magnitude values were used to calculate the area destroyed by the fires.

The data was then transferred to a MySQL database and visualized with Tableau.
